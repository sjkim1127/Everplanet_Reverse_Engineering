## Plugin: decompilation
Decompilation and code recovery tools for binary analysis.

### `emulate_machine_code`

Emulate machine code execution using radare2 ESIL (Evaluable Strings Intermediate Language).

This tool provides safe, sandboxed emulation of binary code without actual execution.
Perfect for analyzing obfuscated code, understanding register states, and predicting
execution outcomes without security risks.

**Key Use Cases:**
- De-obfuscation: Reveal hidden strings by emulating XOR/shift operations
- Register Analysis: See final register values after code execution
- Safe Malware Analysis: Predict behavior without running malicious code

**Safety Features:**
- Virtual CPU simulation (no real execution)
- Instruction count limit (max 1000) prevents infinite loops
- Memory sandboxing (changes don't affect host system)

Args:
    file_path: Path to the binary file (must be in workspace)
    start_address: Address to start emulation (e.g., 'main', '0x401000', 'sym.decrypt')
    instructions: Number of instructions to execute (default 50, max 1000)
    timeout: Execution timeout in seconds

Returns:
    ToolResult with register states and emulation summary

**Arguments:**

- `instructions` (int) (default: `50`)
- `timeout` (int) (default: `120`)

---

### `get_pseudo_code`

Generate pseudo C code (decompilation) for a function using radare2's pdc command.

This tool decompiles binary code into C-like pseudocode, making it much easier
to understand program logic compared to raw assembly. The output can be further
refined by AI for better readability.

**Use Cases:**
- Quick function understanding without reading assembly
- AI-assisted code analysis and refactoring
- Documentation generation from binaries
- Reverse engineering workflow optimization

**Note:** The output is "pseudo C" - it may not be syntactically perfect C,
but provides a high-level representation of the function logic.

Args:
    file_path: Path to the binary file (must be in workspace)
    address: Function address to decompile (e.g., 'main', '0x401000', 'sym.foo')
    timeout: Execution timeout in seconds (default 300)

Returns:
    ToolResult with pseudo C code string

Example:
    get_pseudo_code("/app/workspace/sample.exe", "main")
    # Returns C-like code representation of the main function

**Arguments:**

- `file_path` (str)
- `address` (str) (default: `main`)
- `timeout` (int) (default: `300`)

---

### `recover_structures`

Recover C++ class structures and data types from binary code.

This is THE game-changer for C++ reverse engineering. Transforms cryptic
"this + 0x4" memory accesses into meaningful "Player.health" structure fields.
Uses Ghidra's powerful data type propagation and structure recovery algorithms.

**Why Structure Recovery Matters:**
- **C++ Analysis**: 99% of game clients and commercial apps are C++
- **Understanding**: "this + 0x4" means nothing, "Player.health = 100" tells a story
- **AI Comprehension**: AI can't understand raw offsets, but understands named fields
- **Scale**: One structure definition can clarify thousands of lines of code

**Performance Tips (for large binaries like game clients):**
- Use `fast_mode=True` (default) to skip full binary analysis
- Use `use_ghidra=False` for quick radare2-based analysis
- For best results on first run, set `fast_mode=False` but expect longer wait

**How It Works:**
1. Analyze memory access patterns in the function
2. Identify structure layouts from offset usage
3. Use data type propagation to infer field types
4. Generate C structure definitions with meaningful names

**Use Cases:**
- Game hacking: Recover Player, Entity, Weapon structures
- Malware analysis: Understand malware configuration structures
- Vulnerability research: Find buffer overflow candidates in structs
- Software auditing: Document undocumented data structures

**Ghidra vs Radare2:**
- Ghidra (default): Superior type recovery, structure propagation, C++ support
- Radare2 (fallback): Basic structure definition, faster but less intelligent

Args:
    file_path: Path to the binary file (must be in workspace)
    function_address: Function to analyze for structure usage (e.g., 'main', '0x401000')
    use_ghidra: Use Ghidra for advanced recovery (default True), or radare2 for basic
    fast_mode: Skip full binary analysis for faster startup (default True)
    timeout: Execution timeout in seconds (default 300 seconds)
    ctx: FastMCP Context (auto-injected)

Returns:
    ToolResult with recovered structures in C format:
    {
        "structures": [
            {
                "name": "Player",
                "size": 64,
                "fields": [
                    {"offset": "0x0", "type": "int", "name": "health"},
                    {"offset": "0x4", "type": "int", "name": "armor"},
                    {"offset": "0x8", "type": "Vector3", "name": "position"}
                ]
            }
        ],
        "c_definitions": "struct Player { int health; int armor; Vector3 position; };"
    }

Example:
    # Fast structure recovery (recommended for large binaries)
    recover_structures("/app/workspace/game.exe", "main")

    # More thorough analysis (slower but more accurate)
    recover_structures("/app/workspace/game.exe", "main", fast_mode=False)

    # Use radare2 for quick analysis
    recover_structures("/app/workspace/binary", "0x401000", use_ghidra=False)

**Arguments:**

- `file_path` (str)
- `function_address` (str)
- `use_ghidra` (bool) (default: `True`)
- `fast_mode` (bool) (default: `True`)

- `depth` (int) (default: `8`)
- `max_output_size` (int) (default: `10000000`)
- `timeout` (int) (default: `120`)

---

### `run_binwalk_extract`

Extract embedded files and file systems from a binary using binwalk.

This tool performs deep extraction of embedded content, including:
- Compressed archives (gzip, bzip2, lzma, xz)
- File systems (squashfs, cramfs, jffs2, ubifs)
- Firmware images and bootloaders
- Nested/matryoshka content (files within files)

**Use Cases:**
- **Firmware Analysis**: Extract file systems from router/IoT firmware
- **Malware Unpacking**: Extract payloads from packed/embedded malware
- **Forensics**: Recover embedded files from disk images
- **CTF Challenges**: Extract hidden data from challenge files

Args:
    file_path: Path to the binary file to extract
    output_dir: Directory to extract files to (default: creates temp dir)
    matryoshka: Enable recursive extraction (files within files)
    depth: Maximum extraction depth for nested content (default: 8)
    max_output_size: Maximum output size in bytes
    timeout: Extraction timeout in seconds (default: 600 for large files)

Returns:
    ToolResult with extraction summary including:
    - extracted_files: List of extracted files with paths and types
    - output_directory: Path to extraction output
    - total_size: Total size of extracted content
    - extraction_depth: Maximum depth reached during extraction

Example:
    >>> result = await run_binwalk_extract("/path/to/firmware.bin")
    >>> print(result.data["extracted_files"])
    [{"path": "squashfs-root/etc/passwd", "type": "ASCII text", "size": 1234}, ...]

**Arguments:**

- `file_path` (str)
- `output_dir` (str) (default: `None`)
- `matryoshka` (bool) (default: `True`)
- `depth` (int) (default: `8`)
